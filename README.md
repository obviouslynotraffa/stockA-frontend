**StockA** is a website developed with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS, inspired by [StockX](https://stockx.com/), an online marketplace and sneaker retailer. The goal is to create a modern and responsive user interface for managing and purchasing sneakers. The site was developed to learn the aforementioned tech stack and to adopt best practices to make the site accessible. The intent of this project is purely educational and is not intended to copy or replace the original reference site.
